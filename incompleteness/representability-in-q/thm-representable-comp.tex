\begin{thm}
\ollabel{thm:representable-iff-comp}
A function is representable in $\Th{Q}$ if and only if it is computable.
\end{thm}

There are two directions to proving the theorem. One of them is fairly
straightforward once arithmetization of syntax is in place. The other
direction requires more work.
