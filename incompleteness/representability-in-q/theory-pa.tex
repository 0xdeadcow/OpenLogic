\olsection{The Theory $\Th{PA}$}

A stronger theory than $\Th{Q}$ called \emph{Peano arithmetic} $\Th{PA}$, and
is obtained by adding a schema of induction to~$\Th{Q}$:
\[
(!A(0) \land \lforall[x][(!A(x) \lif !A(x'))]) \lif \lforall[x][!A(x)]
\]
where $!A(x)$ is any formula, possibly with free variables other than
$x$.  Using induction, one can do much better; in fact, it takes a
good deal of work to find ``natural'' statements about the natural
numbers that can't be proved in Peano arithmetic!
