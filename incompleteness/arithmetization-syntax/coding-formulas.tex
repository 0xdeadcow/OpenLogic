\begin{prop}
The relation $\fn{Atom}(x)$ which holds iff $x$ is the G\"odel number
of an atomic !!{formula}, is primitive recursive.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The number $x$ is the G\"odel number of an atomic !!{formula} iff
\begin{enumerate}
\item there are $n$, $j < x$, and $z_1$, \dots, $z_n < x$ such that
\[
x = \Gn{\Obj P^n_j(} \concat z_1 \concat \Gn{,} \concat \dots \concat
\Gn{,} \concat z_n \concat \Gn{)}
\]
and for each $l < n$, $z_l$ is the G\"odel number of a term, or
\item there are $z1, z_2 < x$ such that $x = z_1 \concat \Gn{\eq}
  \concat \eq z_2$ and $z_1$ and $z_2$ are terms.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
The relation $\fn{Frm}(x)$ which holds iff $x$ is the G\"odel number
of a !!a{formula} is primitive recursive.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
A sequence of symbols~$s$ is !!a{formula} iff there is formation
sequence~$s_0$, \dots, $s_{k-1} = s$ of !!{formula} which records
how~$s$ was formed from atomic !!{formula}s according the the
formation rules.  The code for each $s_i$ (and indeed of the code of
the sequence $\tuple{s_0, \dots, s_{k-1}}$ is less than the code~$x$
of~$s$.
\end{proof}
