Emmy Noether was born in Erlangen, Germany, on March 23, 1882, to an
upper-middle class scholarly family. Hailed as the ``mother of modern
algebra,'' Noether made groundbreaking contributions to both
mathematics and physics, despite significant barriers to women's
education. In Germany at the time, young girls were meant to be
educated in arts and were not allowed to attend college preparatory
schools.  However, after auditing classes at the Universities of
G\"{o}ttingen and Erlangen (where her father was professor of
mathematics), Noether was eventually able to enrol as a student at
Erlangen in 1904, when their policy was updated to allow female
students. She received her doctorate in mathematics in 1907.

Despite her qualifications, Noether experienced much resistance during
her career. From 1908--1915, she taught at Erlangen without
pay. During this time, she caught the attention of David Hilbert, one
of the world's foremost mathematicians of the time, who invited her to
G\"{o}ttingen. However, women were prohibited from obtaining
professorships, and she was only able to lecture under Hilbert's name,
again without pay. During this time she proved what is now known as
Noether's theorem, which is still used in theoretical physics
today. Noether was finally granted the right to teach in 1919.
Hilbert's response to continued resistance of his university
colleagues reportedly was: ``Gentlemen, the faculty senate is not a
bathhouse.''

Noether was Jewish, and when the Nazis came to power in 1933, she was
dismissed from her position. Luckily, Noether was able to emigrate to
the United States for a temporary position at Bryn Mawr,
Pennsylvania. During her time there she also lectured at Princeton,
although she found the university to be unwelcoming to women
\citep[81]{Dick1981}. In 1935, Noether underwent an operation to
remove a uterine tumour. She died from an infection as a result of the
surgery, and was buried at Bryn Mawr.

For a biography of Noether, see \citet{Dick1981}.  The Perimeter
Institute for Theoretical Physics has their lectures on Noether's life
and influence available online \citep{Perimeter2015}.  If you're tired
of reading, \emph{Stuff You Missed in History Class} has a podcast on
Noether's life and influence \citep{Frey2015}.  The collected works of
Noether are available in the original German \citet{Noether1983}.
