\begin{thm}[Soundness Theorem]\ollabel{thm:soundness}
  If schemas $!A_1$, \dots, $!A_n$ are valid in the
  classes of models $\mClass{C}_n$, \dots, $\mClass{C}_n$,
  respectively, then $\Log{K}!A_1\dots !A_n
  \Proves !B$ implies that $!B$ is valid in the class of
  models $\mClass{C}_n \cap \dots \cap \mClass{C}_n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  By induction on length of proofs. For brevity, put $\mClass{C} =
  \mClass{C}_n \cap \dots \cap \mClass{C}_n$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Induction Basis: If $!B$ has a proof of length~$1$, then it is
    either a tautological instance or an instance of \Ax{K}, or an
    instance of one of the schemas. In the first case, $!B$ is valid
    in $\mClass{C}$, since tautological instance are valid in
    \emph{any} class of models, by
    \olref[syn][tau]{thm:valid-taut}. Similarly in the second case, by
    \olref[syn][sch]{thm:Kvalid}. Finally in the third case, since
    $!B$ is valid in $\mClass{C}_i$ and $\mClass{C} \subseteq
    \mClass{C}_i$, we have that $!B$ is valid in $\mClass{C}$ as well.
  \item Inductive step: Suppose $!B$ has a proof of length $k>1$. If
    $!B$ is a tautological instance or an instance of one of the
    schemas, we proceed as in the previous step. So suppose $!B$ is
    obtained by \MP{} from previous !!{formula}s $!C \lif !B$ and
    $!C$. Then $!C \lif !B$ and $!C$ have proofs of length $<k$, and
    by inductive hypothesis they are valid in~$\mClass{C}$. By
    \olref[syn][sch]{prop:soundMP}, $!B$ is valid in $\mClass{C}$ as
    well. Finally suppose $!B$ is obtained by \Nec{} from $!C$ (so
    that $!B = \Box!C$). By inductive hypothesis, $!C$ is valid in
    $\mClass{C}$, and by \olref[syn][val]{prop:Nec-rule} so is~$!A$. \qedhere
