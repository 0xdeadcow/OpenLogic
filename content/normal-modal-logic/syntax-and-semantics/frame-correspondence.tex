\olsection{Frame Correspondence}

Even though the converse implications of \olref[acc]{thm:soundschemas}
fail, they hold if we replace ``model'' by ``frame'': for the
properties considered in \olref[acc]{thm:soundschemas}, it \emph{is} true
that if a schema is valid in a \emph{frame} then the accessibility
relation of that frame has the corresponding property. In fact, even
more is true in the case of~\Ax{D}.

\begin{ex}\ollabel{ex:D.complete.for.models}
  Any model where schema \Ax{D} is true is serial.
\end{ex}

\begin{prob}
  Prove \olref[mod][syn][cor]{ex:D.complete.for.models} (Hint:
  take $!A = \lnot\lfalse$).
\end{prob}

Although we will focus on the five classical schemas \Ax{D}, \Ax{T},
\Ax{B}, \Ax{4}, and \Ax{5}, we record in \olref{fig:anotherfive} a few
more correspondences.

\begin{prob}
  Let $\mModel{M} = \tuple{W, R, V}$ be a model. Show that if $R$
  satisfies the left-hand properties of
  \olref[mod][syn][cor]{fig:anotherfive}, the corresponding
  right-hand schemas are true in~$\mModel{M}$.
\end{prob}

We now proceed to establish the full correspondence results for
frames. We will consider \Ax{T}, \Ax{B}, \Ax{4} and \Ax{5}, as the case
for \Ax{D} already follows from \olref{ex:D.complete.for.models}.

\begin{thm}\ollabel{thm:fullCorrespondence}
  Recall that a schema \Ax{S} is valid in a frame  if each of
  its instances is true in every model based on that frame. Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If \Ax{T} is valid in a frame $\mModel{F}$, then
    $\mModel{F}$ is reflexive.
  \item If \Ax{B} is valid in a frame $\mModel{F}$, then
    $\mModel{F}$ is symmetric.
  \item If \Ax{4} is valid in a frame $\mModel{F}$, then
    $\mModel{F}$ is transitive.
  \item If \Ax{5} is valid in a frame $\mModel{F}$, then
    $\mModel{F}$ is euclidean.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  The strategy is to devise, for each frame $\mModel{F}$, a valuation
  that will ensure that the frame has the desired property (provided
  the corresponding schema is true).
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose \Ax{T} is valid in $\mModel{F} =\tuple{W, R}$, let $w \in W$ be
    an arbitrary world; we need to show $Rww$. Fix a propositional
    variable $p$ and let $u \in V(p)$ if and only if $Rwu$ (when $q$
    is other than $p$, $V(q)$ is arbitrary, say $V(q) =
    \emptyset)$. Let $\mModel{M}=\tuple{W, R, V}$. By construction,
    for all $u$ such that $Rwu$: $\mSat{M}{p}[u]$, and hence
    $\mSat{M}{\Box p}[w]$. But by hypothesis $\Box p \lif p$, an
    instance of \Ax{T}, is true at~$w$, so that $\mSat{M}{p}[w]$, but
    by definition of $V$ this is possible only if $Rww$.
  \item Suppose \Ax{B} is valid in $\mModel{F}= \tuple{W,R}$, and let
    $u,v \in W$ be arbitrary worlds such that $Ruv$; we need to show
    that $Rvu$. Fix a propositional variable $p$, define $V$ such that
    $w \in V(p)$ if and only if $Rvw$ (and $V$ is arbitrary
    otherwise). Let $\mModel{M} =\tuple{W, R, V}$. Notice that the
    following instance of \Ax{B}: $\lnot p \lif \Box\Diamond \lnot p$,
    is equivalent to $\Diamond \Box p \lif p$. Now, by definition of
    $V$, $\mSat{M}{p}[w]$ for all $w$ such that $Rvw$, and hence
    $\mSat{M}{\Box p}[v]$. Since $Ruv$, also $\mSat{M}{\Diamond\Box
      p}[u]$, and since \Ax{B} is valid in $\mModel{F}$, also
    $\mSat{M}{\Diamond\Box p \lif p}[u]$. It follows that
    $\mSat{M}{p}[u]$, whence $Rvu$, as required.
  \item Suppose \Ax{4} is valid in $\mModel{F} = \tuple{W,R}$, and let
    $u,v,w \in W$ be arbitrary worlds such that $Ruv$ and $Rvw$; we
    need to show that $Ruw$. Fix a propositional variable $p$, define
    $V$ such that $z \in V(p)$ if and only if $Ruz$ (and $V$ is
    arbitrary otherwise). Let $\mModel{M} =\tuple{W, R, V}$. By
    definition of $V$, $\mSat{M}{p}[z]$ for all $z$ such that $Ruz$,
    and hence $\mSat{M}{\Box p}[u]$. But by hypothesis $\Box p \lif
    \Box \Box p$, an instance of \Ax{4}, is true at $u$, so that
    $\mSat{M}{\Box \Box p}[u]$. Since $Ruv$ and $Rvw$, we have
    $\mSat{M}{p}[w]$, but by definition of $V$ this is possible only
    if $Ruw$, as desired.
  \item We proceed contrapositively, assuming that the frame
    $\mModel{F} = \tuple{W, R}$ is not euclidean, and falsifying an
    instance of \Ax{5}. Suppose there are worlds $u, v, w$ such that
    $Rwu$ and $Rwv$ but not $Ruv$. Fix a propositional variable $p$
    and define $V$ such that for all worlds $z$, $z \in V(p)$ if and
    only if it is \emph{not} the case that $Ruz$. Let $\mModel{M}
    =\tuple{W, R, V}$. Then by hypothesis $\mSat{M}{p}[v]$ and since
    $Rwv$ also $\mSat{M}{\Diamond p}[w]$. However, there is no world
    $y$ such that $Ruy$ and $\mSat{M}{p}[y]$ so $\mSat{M}{\lnot
      \Diamond p}[u]$. Since $Rwu$, it follows that
    $\mSat/{M}{\Box\Diamond p}[w]$, so that the instance of \Ax{5},
    $\Diamond p \lif \Box\Diamond p$ fails at $w$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\olref{thm:fullCorrespondence} also shows that the properties can be
combined: for instance if both \Ax{B} and \Ax{4} are valid in
$\mModel{F}$ then the frame is both symmetric and transitive,
etc. This is useful because the classical systems \Log{S4} and
\Log{S5} are, in fact, just the systems characterized as \Log{KT4} and
\Log{KTB4}.
  
We now record some properties of accessibility relations (in fact,
these notions apply to arbitrary binary relations).

\begin{prop}\ollabel{prop:relation-facts}
  Let $R$ be a binary relation on a set $W$; then:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $R$ is reflexive, then it is serial.
  \item If $R$ is symmetric, then it is transitive if and only if it
    is euclidean.
  \item If $R$ is symmetric or euclidean then it is weakly directed
    (it has the ``diamond property'').
  \item If $R$ is euclidean then it is weakly connected.
  \item If $R$ is functional then it is serial.  
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{prob}
  Prove \olref[mod][syn][cor]{prop:relation-facts}.
\end{prob}
