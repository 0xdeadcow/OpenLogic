\olsection{Turing Machines}

\begin{explain}
The formal definition of what constitutes a Turing machine looks
abstract, but is actually simple: it merely packs into one
mathematical !!{structure} all the information needed to specify the
workings of a Turing machine. This includes (1) which states the
machine can be in, (2) which symbols are allowed to be on the tape, (3)
which state the machine should start in, and (4) what the instruction
set of the machine is.
\end{explain}

\begin{defn}
A \emph{Turing machine} $T = \langle Q, \Sigma, s, I\rangle$ consists of
\begin{enumerate}
\item a finite set of states $Q$,
\item a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ which includes $\TMendtape$ and
  $\TMblank$,
\item an initial state $q_0 \in Q$,
\item a finite instruction set~$I \subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times Q
  \times \Sigma \times \{\TMleft, \TMright, \TMstay\}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{explain}
We assume that the tape is infinite in one direction only. For this
reason it is useful to designate a special symbol~$\TMendtape$ as
a marker for the left end of the tape. This makes it easier for
Turing machne programs to tell when they're ``in danger'' of running
off the tape. 

Classical Turing machines make use of only two symbols: $\TMblank$ and
$\TMstroke$. While it is common to consider Turing machines that use additional
symbols, no extra computing power is gained by this. Anything computable by
a Turing machine is computable by a classical Turing machine. Other
definitions of Turing machines are possible,
including one where the tape is infinite in both directions. In such cases,
the marker for the left end of the tape is not necessary.
\end{explain}

\begin{ex}
\emph{Even Machine:} Define a Turing machine that, given an input of $n$
strokes, halts if, and only if, $n$ is even.

$Q =  \{ q_0, q_1 \}$

$\Sigma = \{ \TMendtape, \TMblank, \TMstroke \}$

$I = \{ \langle q_0, \TMstroke, q_1, \TMstroke, \TMright \rangle$

	  $\langle q_1, \TMstroke, q_0, \TMstroke, \TMright \rangle$
	  
	  $\langle q_0, \TMblank, q_0, \TMblank, \TMright \rangle \}$

\end{ex}
