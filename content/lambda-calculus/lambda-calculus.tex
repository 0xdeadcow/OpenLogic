\part{The Lambda Calculus}

\begin{editorial}
This part deals with the lambda calculus. The introduction chapter is
based on Jeremy's notes; part of it is now redundant and covered in
later chpaters. Chapters on syntax, Church-Rosser, and
representability were produced by Zesen Qian during his Mitacs summer
internship. They still have to be reviewed and revised.
