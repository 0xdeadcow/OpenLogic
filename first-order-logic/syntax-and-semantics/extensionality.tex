\olsection{Extensionality}

\begin{explain}
Extensionality, sometimes called relevance, can be expressed
informally as follows: the only thing that bears upon the satisfaction
of !!{formula}~$!A$ in a !!{structure}~$\Struct M$ relative to a
!!{variable} assignment~$s$, are the assignments made by ~$\Struct M$
and ~$s$ to the elements of the language that actually appear in
~$!A$.

One immediate consequence of extensionality is that where two
!!{structure}s~$\Struct M$ and ~$\Struct M'$ agree on all the elements
of the language appearing in a sentence~$!A$ and have the same domain,
~$\Struct M$ and ~$\Struct M'$ must also agree on~$!A$ itself.
\end{explain}

\begin{prop}[Extensionality]
Let $!A$ be a sentence, and $\Struct M$ and $\Struct M'$ be !!{structure}s. 
If $\Assign{c}{M} = \Assign{c}{M'}$, $\Assign{R}{M}=\Assign{R}{M'}$, and 
$\Assign{f}{M} = \Assign{f}{M'}$ for every !!{constant} $c$, relation 
symbol $R$, and !!{function} $f$ occurring in $!A$, then $\Sat{M}{!A}$ 
iff $\Sat{M'}{!A}$.
\end{prop}
