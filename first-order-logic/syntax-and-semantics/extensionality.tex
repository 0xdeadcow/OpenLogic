\olsection{Extensionality}

\begin{explain}
Extensionality, sometimes called relevance, can be expressed informally as follows: the only thing that bears upon the satisfaction of !!{formula}~$!A$ in a !!{structure}~$\Struct M$ relative to a !!{variable} assignment~$s$, are the assignments made by ~$\Struct M$ and ~$s$ to the elements of the language that actually appear in ~$!A$.

One immediate consequence of extensionality is that where two !!{structures}~$\Struct M$ and ~$\Struct N$ agree on all the elements of the language appearing in a sentence~$!A$ and have the same domain, ~$\Struct M$ and ~$\Struct N$ must also agree on ~$!A$ itself.

We will now give a formal statement of the theorem and prove it.
