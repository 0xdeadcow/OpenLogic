\section{Semantic Notions}

\begin{wordy}
Give the definition of structures for first order langauges, we can
define some basic semantic properties of and relationships between
sentences.  The simplest of these is the notion of \emph{validity} of
a sentence.  A sentence is valid if it is satisfied in every
structure.  Valid sentences are those that are satisfied regardless of
how the non-logical symbols in it are interpreted.  Valid sentences
are therefore also called \emph{logical truths}---they are true, i.e.,
satisifed, in any structure and hence their truth depends only on the
logical symbols occuring in it and their syntactic structure, but not
on the non-logical symbols or their interpretation.  
\end{wordy}

\begin{defn}[Validity]
A sentence $!A$ is \emph{valid}, $\Entails !A$, iff $\Sat{M}{!A}$ for every
structure~$\Struct M$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Entailment]
A set of sentences~$\Gamma$ \emph{entails} a sentence~$!A$, $\Gamma
\Entails !A$, iff for every structure~$\Struct M$ with
$\Sat{M}{\Gamma}$, $\Sat{M}{!A}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Satisfiability]
A set of sentences~$\Gamma$ is \emph{satisfiable} if $\Sat{M}{\Gamma}$
for some structure~$\Struct M$.  If $\Gamma$ is not satisfiable it is
called \emph{unsatisfiable}.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
A sentence $!A$ is valid iff $\Gamma \Entails !A$ for every set of
sentences~$\Gamma$.
\end{prop}

% Dana: prove this

\begin{prop}
$\Gamma \Entails !A$ iff $\Gamma \cup \{\lnot !A}$ is unsatisfiable.
\end{prop}

% Dana: prove this

\begin{prop}
If $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma'$ and $\Gamma \Entails !A$, then $\Gamma'
\Entails !A$.
\end{prop}

% Dana: prove this

\begin{thm}[Semantic Deduction Theorem]
If $\Gamma \cup \{!A\} \Entails !B$ iff $\Gamma \Entails !A \lif !B$.
\end{thm}
