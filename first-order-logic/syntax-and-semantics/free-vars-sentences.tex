\olsection{Free Variables and Sentences}

\begin{defn}[Free occurrences of a variable]
The \emph{free} occurrences of a variable in a !!{formula} are defined
inductively:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $!A$ is atomic, all variable occurrences in $!A$ are free.
\item If $!A$ is a !!{formula}, then the free variable occurrences of
  $\lnot !A$ are exactly those of $!A$.
\item If $!A$ and $!B$ are !p{formula}, then the free variable
  occurrences in $(!A \land !B)$ are those in $!A$ together with those
  in $!B$.
\item If $!A$ and $!B$ are !p{formula}, then the free variable
  occurrences in $(!A \lor !B)$ are those in $!A$ together with those
  in $!B$.
\item If $!A$ and $!B$ are !p{formula}, then the free variable
  occurrences in $(!A \lif !B)$ are those in $!A$ together with those
  in $!B$.
\item If $!A$ and $!B$ are !p{formula}, then the free variable
  occurrences in $(!A \liff !B)$ are those in $!A$ together with those
  in $!B$.
\item If $!A$ is a !!{formula}, then the free variable occurrences in
  $\lforall[x][!A]$ are all of those in $!A$ except for occurrences of
  $x$.
\item If $!A$ is a !!{formula}, then the free variable occurrences in
  $\lexists[x][!A]$ are all of those in $!A$ except for occurrences of
  $x$.
\end{enumerate}
% Again, if we could figure out a way to condense those clauses and
% still be able to allow people to "pick and choose" which logical
% connectives to use, that would look better
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Sentence]
A !!{formula} $!A$ is a \emph{sentence} iff it contains no free
occurrences of variables.
\end{defn}
