\olsection{Operations on functions}

\begin{wordy}
We've already seen that the inverse of a one-to-one function $f^{-1}$ is itself a function. It is also possible to compose functions.
\end{wordy}

\begin{defn}
 Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ and $g: Y \rightarrow W$. Then we \emph{compose} $g$ and $f$ to form the function $g \circ f: X \rightarrow W$, where $g \circ f(x) =
    g(f(x))$.
\end{defn}

\begin{wordy}
The function $g \circ f:  X \rightarrow W$ pairs each member of $X$ with a member of $W$. We specify which member of $W$ a member of $X$ is paired with as follows---given an input $x\in X$, first apply the function $f$, to $x$ which will output some $y\in Y$. Then apply the function $g$ to $y$, which will out put some $w\in W$. 
\end{wordy}

\begin{ex}
Consider the functions $f(x) = x + 1$, and $g(x) = 2x$. What function do you get when you compose these two? $g \circ f(x) = g(f(x))$. So that means for every natural number you give this function, you first add one, and then you multiply the result by two. So their composition is $g \circ f(x) = 2(x+1)$.
\end{ex}

\begin{prob}
Show that if the functions $g: X \rightarrow Y$ and $f: Y \rightarrow W$ are both bijections then $g \circ f: X \rightarrow W$ is also a bijection.
\end{prob}
