\olsection{Introduction}

When Georg Cantor developed set theory in the 1870's, his 
interest was in part to make palatable the idea of an infinite 
collection --- an actual infinity, as the medievals would say. 
Key to this rehabilitation of the notion of the infinite was the 
notion of countability.
