\olsection{Special properties of relations}

\begin{intro}
Some kinds of relations turn out to be so common that they have been
given special names.  For instance, $\le$ and $\subseteq$ both relate
their respective domains (say, $\Nat$ in the case of $\le$ and
$\Pow(X)$ in the case of $\subseteq$) in similar ways.  To get at
exactly how these relations are similar, and how they differ, we
categorize them according to some special properties that relations
can have.  It turns out that (combinations of) some of these special
properties are especially important: orders and equivalence relations.
\end{intro}

\begin{defn}
A relation $R \subset X^2X$ is \emph{reflexive} iff, for every $x \in
X$, $Rxx$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A relation $R \subseteq X^2$ is \emph{transitive} iff, whenever $Rxy$
and $Ryz$, then also $Rxz$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A relation~$R \subset X^2$ is \emph{symmetric} iff, whenever both
$Rxy$, then $Ryx$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A relation~$R \subset X^2$ is \emph{anti-symmetric} iff, whenever both
$Rxy$ and $Ryx$, then $x=y$ (or, in other words: if $x\neq y$ then
either $\not Rxy$ or $\not Ryx$).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A relation $R$ is \emph{total} if for all $x,y\in X$,
either $Rxy$ or $Ryx$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A relation~$R \subseteq X^2$ that is reflexive, transitive, and
anti-symmetric is called a \emph{partial order}.  A partial order that
is also total is called a \emph{linear order}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A relation $R \subseteq X^2$ that is reflexive, symmetric, and
transitive is called an \emph{equivalence relation}.
\end{defn}

\begin{prob}
Give examples of relations that are (a) reflexive and symmetric but
not transitive, (b) reflexive and anti-symmetric, (c) anti-symmetric,
transitive, but not reflexive, and (d) reflexive, symmetric, and
transitive.  Do not use relations on numbers or sets.
\end{prob}
