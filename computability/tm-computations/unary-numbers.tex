\olsection{Unary Representation of Numbers}

\begin{wordy}
Turing machines work on sequences of symbols written on their tape.
Depending on the alphabet a Turing machine uses, these sequences of
symbols can represent various inuts and outputs.  Of particular
interest, of course, are Turing machines which compute
\emph{arithmetical} functions, i.e., functions of natural numbers.
One very simple way to represent positive integers is by coding them
as sequences of a single symbol~\TMstroke.
\end{wordy}

\begin{defn}
A Turing machine~$M$ \emph{computes} the function $f\colon \Nat^n \to \Nat$ iff
$M$ halts on input
\[
\TMstroke^{k_1} \TMblank \dots \TMblank \TMstroke^{k_n}
\]
with output $\TMblank^{f(k_1, \dots, k_n)}$.
\end{defn}
