\olsection{The Normal Form Theorem}

\begin{thm}[Kleene's Normal Form Theorem]
There are a primitive recursive relation $T(e, x, s)$ and a primitive
recursive function $U(s)$, with the following property: if $f$ is any
partial recursive function, then for some~$e$,
\[
f(x) \simeq U(\mu s \; T(e, x, s))
\]
for every $x$.
\end{thm}

\begin{explain}
The proof of the norm is involved, but the basic idea is simple.
Every partial recursive function has an \emph{index}~$e$, intuitively,
a number coding its program or definition.  If $f(x) \defined$, the
computation can be recorded systematically and coded by some
number~$s$, and that $s$ codes the computation of $f$ on input $x$ can
be checked primitive recursively using only $x$ and the
definition~$e$.  This means that $T$ is primitive recursive.  Given
the full record of the computation~$s$, the ``upshot'' of~$s$ is the
value of~$f(x)$, and it can be obtained from~$s$ primitive recursively
as well.  The normal form theorem shows that only a single unbounded
search is required for the definition of any partial recursive
function.
