\olsection{Outline of Proof}

\begin{explain}
The proof of undecidability is complex, and it will be beneficial to
outline the proof first. We will proceed in five parts. First, we show that
if FOL with identity and terms ($\Lang{L_T}$) is decidable, then the
halting problem is solvable (i.e., we reduce the halting problem to the
decision problem). We then show that for any sentence $A$ of $L_T$,
$\Sat{}{\lforall{x}\lexists{y}{\Atom{R}{x}{y}}\lif A'}$ if, and only if,
$\Sat{}{A}$. From these two things, it follows that if FOL with identity
($\Lang{L_=}$) is decidable, then the halting problem is also solvable. We
then prove that for any sentence A of $\Lang{L_=} , \Sat{}{(A \land B) \lif
A (something)}$. Finally, we can then show that if FOL without identity and
terms is decidable, then the halting problem is solvable.
